#Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

#The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

#The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

#Example Input
#weight = 80
#height = 1.75
#Example Output
#80 ÷ (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
#26
#here we can see that the output is in an integer
#  Don't change the code below 
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
#  Don't change the code above 

#Write your code below this line 
print(int(int(weight)//(float(height)**2)))
